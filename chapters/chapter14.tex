\chapter{Duality for Normed Linear Spaces}

For a normed linear space $X$, we denoted the normed linear space of continuous linear real-valued functions of $X$ by $X^*$ and called it the \textbf{dual space} of $X$.
We aim to explore properties of the mapping from $X\times X^*$ to $\mathbb{R}$ defined by
\[
    (x,\psi)\mapsto\psi(x)\text{ for all }x\in X,\psi\in X^*.
\]

Hahn-Banach Theorem: extension of certain linear functionals on subspaces of an unnormed linear space to linear functionals on the whole space.
Hahn-Banach implies:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item for a normed linear space $X$, any bounded linear functional on a subspace of $X$ may be extended to a bounded linear functional on all of $X$, without increasing its norm
    \item for a locally convex Topological vector space $X$, any two disjoint closed convex sets of $X$ may be separated by a closed hyperplane
    \item for a reflexive Banach space $X$, any bounded sequence in $X$ has a weakly convergent subsequence.
\end{enumerate}

    \item three
    \item Show that if $X$ is a finite dimensional normed linear space, then every linear functional on $X$ is continuous.
    
    This was proved in Chapter 13 Problem 26.

    % For $(\mathbb{R}^n,\|\cdot\|_2)$, define $\psi(x):=\langle x, \frac{v}{\|v\|_2}\rangle$ so that $\psi(v)=\|v\|_2/\|v\|_2=1$.
