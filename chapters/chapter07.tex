\section{Normed Linear Spaces}
\begin{flushleft}
	
	Throughout this chapter $E$ denotes a measurable set of real numbers.
	Define $\mathcal{F}$ to be the collection of all measurable extended real-valued functions on $E$ that are finite a.e. on $E$.
	We can say that two functions $f,g\in\mathcal{F}$ are equivalent, denoted by $f\cong g$, provided
	\[
	f(x)=g(x)\text{ for almost all }x\in E.	
	\]
	This is an equivalence relation and induces a partition of $\mathcal{F}$ into a disjoint collection of equivalence classes, denoted by $\mathcal{F}/\cong$, which is a linear space.
	There is a natural family $\{L^p(E)\}_{1\le p\le\infty}$ of subspaces of $\mathcal{F}/\cong$.
	\\
	For $1\le p<\infty$, define $L^p(E)$ to be the collection of equivalence class $[f]$ for which 
	\[
	\int_E|f|^p<\infty.	
	\]
	Then if $f\cong g$, then $\int_E|f|^p=\int_E|g|^p$.
	Showing that $L^p(E)$ is closed under linear combinations will prove that $L^p(E)$ is a linear subspace.
	To do this, let $c=\max\{|a|,|b|\}$ so that
	\[
	|a+b|\le|a|+|b|\le 2c,
	\]
	which implies
	\[
	|a+b|^p\le 2^pc^p\le2^p(|a|^p+|b|^p).	
	\]
	This inequality, together with the linearity and monotonicity of integration tells us that 
	\[
		\int_E|\alpha f+\beta g|^p \le 2^p(|\alpha|^p\int_E|f|^p+|\beta|^p\int_E| g|^p)<\infty.
	\]
	That is, for $[f],[g]\in L^p(E)$, then $\alpha[f]+\beta[g]\in L^p(E)$.\\
	We call a function $f\in\mathcal{F}$ \textbf{essentially bounded} provided there is some $M\ge 0$, called an \textbf{essential upper bound} for $f$, for which
	\[
	|f(x)|\le M\text{ for almost all }x\in E.	
	\]
	Then we can define $L^\infty(E)$ to be the collection of equivalence classes $[f]$ for which $f$ is essentially bounded. 
	Clearly $L^\infty(E)$ is a linear subspace because
	\[
	|\alpha f(x)+\beta g(x)|\le|\alpha| |f(x)|+|\beta|| g(x)|\le |\alpha| M + |\beta|M' = M'' \text{ a.e. on $E$}
	\]
	To state that a function $f$ in $L^p[a,b]$ is continuous means that there is a continuous function that agrees with $f$ a.e. on $[a,b]$.
	There is only one such continuous function and it is often convenient to consider this unique continuous function as the representative of $[f]$.\\
	It is useful to consider real-valued functions that have as their domain linear spaces of functions: such functions are called \textbf{functionals}.

	\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
		Let $X$ be a linear space.
		A real-valued functional $\|\cdot\|$  on $X$ is called a \textbf{norm} provided for each $f$ and $g$ in $X$ and each real number $\alpha$,\\
		(The Triangle Inequality)
		\[
			\|f+g\|\le\|f\|+\|g\|,
		\]
		(Positive Homogeneity)
		\[
			\|\alpha f\|=|\alpha|\|f\|,	
		\]
		(Nonnegativity)
		\[
			\|f\|\ge 0\text{ and }\|f\|=0 \iff f=0.
		\]
	\end{namedthm*}
	A \textbf{normed linear space} is a linear space together with a norm.
	If $X$ is a linear space normed by $\|\cdot\|$ we say that a function $f$ in $X$ is a \textbf{unit function} provided $\|f\|=1$.
	For any $f\in X,f\neq 0$, the function $\frac{f}{\|f\|}$ is a unit function: it is a scalar multiple of $f$ which we call the \textbf{normalization} of $f$.

	\begin{namedthm*}{Example}[The Normed Linear Space $L^1(E)$]
		For a function $f$ in $L^1(E)$, define
		\[
		\|f\|_1=\int_E|f|.	
		\]
		Then $\|\cdot\|$ is a norm on $L^1(E)$.\\
		For $f,g\in L^1(E)\subseteq \mathcal{F}$, since $f$ and $g$ are finite a.e. on $E$, the triangle inequality for real numbers tells us that
		\[
		|f+g|\le|f|+|g|\text{ a.e. on }E.	
		\]
		Then by the monotonicity and linearity of integration, we have subadditivity:
		\[
			\|f+g\|_1=\int_E|f+g| \le \int_E[|f|+|g|] = \int_E|f| +\int_E|g| = \|f\|_1+\|g\|_1.	
		\]
		By the linearity of integration, clearly we have absolute homogeneity:
		\[
			\|\alpha f\|_1 = \int_E|\alpha f| = \int_E|\alpha| |f|=|\alpha|\int_E| f| = |\alpha|\|f\|_1.	
		\]
		Clearly $\|f\|$ is nonnegative. Finally, if $f\in L^1(E)$ and $\|f\|_1=0$, then $f=0$ a.e. on $E$. 
		Therefore $[f]$ is the zero element of the linear space $L^1(E)\subseteq \mathcal{F}/\cong$, that is $f=0$.
	\end{namedthm*}

	\begin{namedthm*}{Example}[The Normed Linear Space $L^\infty(E)$]
		For a function $f$ in $L^\infty(E)$, define $\|f\|_\infty$ to be the infimum of the essential upper bounds for $f$.
		\[
			\|f\|_\infty = \inf\{M\ :\ |f(x)|\le M\text{ a.e. on }E\}.
		\]
		We call $\|f\|_\infty$ the \textbf{essential supremum} of $f$ and claim that $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ is a norm on $L^\infty(E)$.
		\\Nonnegativity and positive homogeneity are clear. 
		\\To show that the triangle inequality holds, we see that for each natural number $n$, there is a subset $E_n$ of $E$ for which
		\[
		|f|\le \|f\|_\infty + \frac{1}{n}\text{ on }E\setminus E_n\text{ and }m(E_n)=0.	
		\]
		This is true because $\|f\|_\infty$ is the infimum, the greatest lower bound, so $\|f\|_\infty + \frac{1}{n}$ is not a lower bound and thus there exists a real number $M$ in the set of upper bounds a.e. of $f$ for which $\|f\|_\infty\le M < \|f\|_\infty + \frac{1}{n}$ a.e. on $E$, and so $|f|\le M < \|f\|_\infty + \frac{1}{n}$ a.e. on $E$.
		\\Accepting that the union of sets of measure zero is also measure zero, we can let $E_\infty = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty E_n$, and so 
		\[
		|f|\le \|f\|_\infty \text{ on }E\setminus E_\infty\text{ and }m(E_n\infty)=0.	
		\]
		Thus we have that $|f|\le \|f\|_\infty$ a.e. on $E$; i.e., ess. sup$f$ is the smallest essential upper bound for $f$.
		\\Now, for $f,g\in L^\infty(E)$, 
		\[
			|f+g|\le|f|+|g|\le\|f\|_\infty+\|g\|_\infty\text{ a.e. on }E.
		\]
		Therefore $\|f\|_\infty+\|g\|_\infty$ is an essential bound for $f+g$ and thus the smallest essential upper bound, $\|f+g\|_\infty$, is such that
		\[
		\|f+g\|_\infty \le \|f\|_\infty+\|g\|_\infty.	
		\]
	\end{namedthm*}

	\begin{namedthm*}{Example}[The Normed Linear Spaces $\ell^1$ and $\ell^\infty$]
		For $1\le p<\infty$, define $\ell^p$ to be the collection of real sequences $a=(a_1,a_2,\cdots)$ for which 
		\[
		\sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k|^p<\infty .	
		\]
		Let $a,b \in \ell^p$, and let $\alpha , \beta$ be real numbers.
		Then we have that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k|^p<\infty$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty|b_k|^p<\infty$.
		Using the inequality $|a+b|^p\le2^p(|a|^p+|b|^p)$, we have
		\begin{align*}
			\sum_{k=1}^\infty|\alpha a_k + \beta b_k|^p &\le \sum_{k=1}^\infty[2^p(|\alpha a_k|^p + |\beta b_k|^p)]\\ 
			&=\sum_{k=1}^\infty2^p|\alpha|^p |a_k|^p+\sum_{k=1}^\infty2^p|\beta|^p| b_k|^p\\
			&=2^p|\alpha|^p\sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k|^p+2^p|\beta|^p\sum_{k=1}^\infty| b_k|^p\\
			&< 2^p|\alpha|^p\infty+2^p|\beta|^p\infty\\
			&=\infty.
		\end{align*}
		Thus $\ell^p$ is a linear space.\\
		We define $\ell^\infty$ to be the linear space of real bounded sequences: that is, for any $\{a_k\}$ in $\ell^\infty$, there exists a real number $M$ for which $|a_k|\le M$ for all $k$.
		We can define the following norms:
		\\For $\{a_k\}\in\ell^1$:
		\[
			\|\{a_k\}\|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k|
		\]
		For $\{a_k\}\in\ell^\infty$:
		\[
			\|\{a_k\}\|_\infty = \sup_{1\le k<\infty}|a_k|
		\]
	\end{namedthm*}

	\begin{namedthm*}{Example}[The Normed Linear Space $C\lbrack a,b\rbrack$]
		Let $[a,b]$ be a closed, bounded interval. 
		The the linear space of continuous real-valued functions on $[a,b]$ is denoted by $C[a,b]$. 
		Since a continuous function on a compact set takes on a maximum value (ch1 problem 52), we can define
		\[
		\|f\|_{\max}=\max_{x\in [a,b]}|f(x)|.	
		\]		
	\end{namedthm*}

	\textbf{PROBLEMS}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{0}
	\item For $f$ in $C[a,b]$, Define
	\[
	\| f \|_1 = \int_a^b |f|.	
	\]
	Show that this is a norm on $C[a,b]$.
	Also show that there is no number $c \ge 0$ for which
	\[
	\| f \|_{\max}	\le c \| f \|_1 \text{ for all $f$ in $C[a,b]$},
	\]
	but there is a $c \ge 0$ for which 
	\[
	\| f \|_1	\le c \| f \|_{\max} \text{ for all $f$ in $C[a,b]$}.
	\]
	\\
	Let $f,g\in C[a,b]$. For each $x\in [a.b]$, we have the inequality $|f(x)+g(x)|\le|f(x)|+|g(x)|$, so by monotonicity and linearity of integration,
	\[
	\|f+g\|_1=\int_a^b|f(x)+g(x)| \le \int_a^b[|f(x)|+|g(x)|] = \int_a^b|f(x)| +\int_a^b|g(x)| = \|f\|_1+\|g\|_1.	
	\]
	Therefore subadditivity holds.\\
	Also, by linearity of integration, we have
	\[
	\|\alpha f\|_1 = \int_a^b|\alpha f| = \int_a^b|\alpha| |f|=|\alpha|\int_a^b| f| = |\alpha|\|f\|_1.	
	\]
	Therefore absolute homogeneity holds.\\
	Finally, by definition of absolute value, $0 \le |f(x)|$ for all $x\in [a,b]$, and by monotonicity of integration,
	\[
	0=\int_a^b 0 \le \int_a^b |f| = \|f\|_1.	
	\] 
	Clearly $\int_a^b |f| = 0$ iff $f\equiv 0$ on $[a,b]$.
	Therefore positive definiteness holds.\\
	Thus $\|\cdot\|_1$ is a norm on $C[a,b]$.\\
	\\Consider the interval $[a,b]=[0,1]$.
	For any $c>0$ we choose, there exists an $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n> c$, with the continuous function $f_n:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$ defined as
	\[ 
		f_n(x) =
		\begin{cases} 
			\frac{n-0}{1/n-0}x& \text{ if } x \in [0,\frac{1}{n}]\\
			\frac{0-n}{2/n-1/n}(x-\frac{1}{n})+n & \text{ if } x \in (\frac{1}{n},\frac{2}{n}]\\
			0& \text{ if } x \in (\frac{2}{n},1]
		\end{cases}
		=
		\begin{cases} 
			n^2x& \text{ if } x \in [0,\frac{1}{n}]\\
			-n^2(x-\frac{1}{n})+n & \text{ if } x \in (\frac{1}{n},\frac{2}{n}]\\
			0& \text{ if } x \in (\frac{2}{n},1]
		\end{cases}
	\]
	(This is a triangle-shaped function that reaches its peak $n$ at $x=\frac{1}{n}$.)\\
	Now, for any $n$, we have $\|f_n\|_1 = \int_0^1|f_n|=1$, and $\|f_n\|_{\max} = n$.\\
	Then $\| f_n \|_{\max}=n > c =  c \| f_n\|_1$.\\
	\\
	Finally, we can see that for any $f$ in $C[a,b]$, by monotonicity of the integral, 
	\begin{align*}
	\|f\|_1 &= \int_a^b|f(x)|\\ 
	&\le \int_a^b\max_{x\in [a,b]}|f(x)|\\
	&=\max_{x\in [a,b]}|f(x)| \int_a^b1\\
	&= \max_{x\in [a,b]}|f(x)| \cdot m([a,b]) \\
	&= \|f\|_{\max} \cdot m([a,b]).
	\end{align*}
	Therefore $\|f\|_1\le m([a,b])\|f\|_{\max}$ for all $f\in C[a,b]$.
	\item Let $X$ be the family of all polynomials with real coefficients defined on $\mathbb{R}$.
	Show that this is a linear space. For a polynomial $p$, define $\| p\|$ to be the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of $p$.
	Is this a norm?\\
	For any two polynomials $p,q\in X$, there exists natural numbers $n,m$ (suppose without loss of generality that $n\le m$) such that
	\begin{align*}
	p(x) &= a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^n+\cdots+0x^m	\\
	q(x) &= b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots+b_{n-1}x^{n-1}+b_nx^n+\cdots+b_mx^m	
	\end{align*}
	Now, considering any scalars $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha p(x) + \beta q(x) &= \alpha (a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_nx^n)\\
		&+ \beta (b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\cdots+b_{m-1}x^{m-1}+b_mx^m)\\
		&=(\alpha a_0)+(\alpha a_1)x+(\alpha a_2)x^2+\cdots+(\alpha a_{n-1})x^{n-1}+(\alpha a_n)x^n\\
		&+ (\beta b_0)+(\beta b_1)x+(\beta b_2)x^2+\cdots+(\beta b_{n-1})x^{n-1}+(\beta b_n)x^n+\cdots+(\beta b_m)x^m\\
		&=(\alpha a_0+\beta b_0)+(\alpha a_1+\beta b_1)x+\cdots+(\alpha a_n+\beta b_n)x^n+\cdots+(\beta b_m)x^m
	\end{align*}
	This is also a polynomial, as for each $i$, we have $(\alpha a_i+\beta b_i) \in \mathbb{R}$, so $X$ is a linear space.\\
	Now, for any polynomial
	\[
		p(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_nx^n,	
	\]
	we can define $\|p\| = |a_0|+|a_1|+|a_2|+\cdots+|a_n| = \sum_{i=0}^n|a_i|$.\\
	The triangle inequality is clear because 
	\[
		\|p+q\| = \sum_{i=0}^{m}|a_i+b_i|\le\sum_{i=0}^{m}[|a_i|+|b_i|]=\sum_{i=0}^{m}|a_i|+\sum_{i=0}^{m}|b_i|=\|p\|+\|q\|.
	\]
	Absolute homogeneity is clear because
	\[
		\|\alpha p\| = \sum_{i=0}^n|\alpha a_i|= \sum_{i=0}^n|\alpha|| a_i|=|\alpha|\sum_{i=0}^n| a_i|=|\alpha|\|p\|.
	\]
	Finally, positive definiteness is clear because
	\[
		0 \le |a_i| \implies 0\le \sum_{i=0}^n| a_i|=\|p\|,
	\]
	And $\|p\|=0$ if and only if $p(x)= 0+0x+0x^2+\cdots0x^n=0$.
	\item For $f$ in $L^1[a,b]$, define $\|f\| = \smallint_a^b x^2 |f(x)|dx$.
	Show that this is a norm on $L^1[a,b]$.\\
	For $f\in L^1[a,b]$, then $f$ is measurable and finite a.e. on $[a,b]$, and $\int_a^b|f(x)|dx<\infty$.\\
	Let $f,g\in L^1[a,b]$, and let $\alpha$ be a real number.\\
	Because the triangle inequality holds a.e. on $[a,b]$, by monotonicity and linearity of the integral, we have
	\begin{align*}
	\|f+g\|&=\int_a^b x^2 |f(x)+g(x)|dx\\
	&\le\int_a^b x^2 [|f(x)|+|g(x)|]dx\\
	&=\int_a^b [x^2 |f(x)|+x^2|g(x)|]dx\\
	&=\int_a^b x^2 |f(x)|dx+\int_a^b x^2 |g(x)|dx\\
	&= \|f\|+\|g\|.	
	\end{align*}
	Therefore $\|\cdot\|$ is subadditive.\\
	By linearity of the integral, we have
	\[
	\|\alpha f\| = \int_a^bx^2|\alpha f(x)|dx = \int_a^bx^2|\alpha| |f(x)|dx=|\alpha |\int_a^bx^2 |f(x)|dx	=|\alpha |\|f\|.
	\]
	Therefore $\|\cdot\|$ satisfies absolute homogeneity.\\
	We can use the fact that $0\le x^2$ and $0\le |f(x)|$ implies $0\le x^2|f(x)|$.
	By monotonicity of the integral, we have
	\[
	0=\int_a^b0dx \le \int_a^bx^2|f(x)|dx = \|f\|.
	\]
	Clearly $\|f\|=0$ if and only if $f=0$ a.e. on $[a,b]$ because $x^2\cdot 0 = 0$.\\
	Therefore $\|\cdot \|$ satisfies positive definiteness.
	\item For $f$ in $L^\infty[a,b]$, show that 
	\[
	\| f\|_\infty = \min \biggl \{ M \ \biggl |\ m \{x \in [a,b]\ |\ |f(x)| > M \} =0 \biggr \},
	\] 
	\\
	That is, the sup norm is the smallest real number $M$ such that $|f(x)|>M$ only on a set of measure zero.
	In an above example, we showed that $\|f\|_\infty$ is the smallest essential upper bound for $f$.
	That is, $|f|\le\|f\|_\infty$ a.e. on $E$ (That is, the inequality is true for $E\setminus E_0$, where $m(E_0)=0$.)
	\\
	and if, furthermore, $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, that
	\[
	\| f \|_{\infty} = \| f \|_{\max}.	
	\]
	If $f$ is continuous, then there are no jump discontinuities ($f$ is continuous at $x_0$ iff $f(x_0^-)=f(x_0)=f(x_0^+)$).
	Then $|f|\le\|f\|_\infty$ everywhere on $E$.
	\item Show that $\ell^\infty$ and $\ell^1$ are normed linear spaces.\\
	$\ell^\infty$:\\
	Let $a,b \in \ell^\infty$, and let $\alpha , \beta$ be real numbers.\\
	Then for some real numbers $M,N$, we have that $|a_k|\le M$ and $|b_k|\le N$ for all $k$.
	\begin{align*}
		\alpha a + \beta b &= \alpha (a_1,a_2,\cdots)+ \beta (b_1,b_2,\cdots)\\		
		&= (\alpha a_1,\alpha a_2,\cdots)+ (\beta b_1,\beta b_2,\cdots)\\
		&= (\alpha a_1+\beta b_1,\alpha a_2+\beta b_2,\cdots)
	\end{align*}
	Then $|\alpha a_k+\beta b_k|\le \alpha M + \beta N$ for all $k$, and $\ell^\infty$ is a linear space.\\
	To show that $\|a\|_\infty = \sup_{1\le k<\infty}|a_k|$ is a norm:
	\[
		\|a+b\|_\infty = \sup_{1\le k<\infty}|a_k+b_k|\le \sup_{1\le i<\infty}|a_i| + \sup_{1\le j<\infty}|b_j| = \|a\|_\infty + \|b\|_\infty,
	\]
	\[
		\|\alpha a\|_\infty = \sup_{1\le k<\infty}|\alpha a_k| = \sup_{1\le k<\infty}|\alpha|| a_k|= |\alpha|\sup_{1\le k<\infty}| a_k|=|\alpha|\|a\|_\infty, 
	\]
	\[
		0 \le \sup_{1\le k<\infty}| a_k| = \|a\|_\infty,\text{ and }\sup_{1\le k<\infty}| a_k|=0\text{ iff }a_k=0\text{ for all }k.	
	\]
	\\
	$\ell^1$:\\
	Let $a,b \in \ell^1$, and let $\alpha , \beta$ be real numbers.\\
	Then we have that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k|<\infty$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty|b_k|<\infty$.\\
	By the triangle inequality for real numbers, we have
	\[
		\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\alpha a_k + \beta b_k| \le\sum_{k=1}^\infty[ |\alpha|| a_k| + | \beta ||b_k|]= |\alpha|\sum_{k=1}^\infty | a_k| + |\beta |\sum_{k=1}^\infty |b_k| <|\alpha|\infty+|\beta|\infty = \infty.
	\]
	Therefore $\ell^1$ is a linear space.\\
	To show that $\|a\|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k|$ is a norm:
	\[
		\|a+b\|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k+b_k|\le\sum_{k=1}^\infty[|a_k|+|b_k|]=\sum_{k=1}^\infty|a_k|+\sum_{k=1}^\infty|b_k|<\infty +\infty = \infty,
	\]
	\[
		\|\alpha a\|_1 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty|\alpha a_k| = \sum_{k=1}^\infty|\alpha|| a_k|=|\alpha|\sum_{k=1}^\infty| a_k|=|\alpha|\|a\|_1, 
	\]
	\[
		0 \le | a_k| \implies 0 \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty |a_k| = \|a\|_1,\text{ and }\sum_{k=1}^\infty| a_k|=0\text{ iff }a_k=0\text{ for all }k.

\section{The Inequalities of Young, H\"older, and Minkowski}

\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
	The conjugate of a number $p\in(1,\infty)$ is the number $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$, which is the unique number $q\in(1,\infty)$ for which 
	\[
		\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1.
	\]
	The conjugate of $1$ is defined to be $\infty$ and the conjugate of $\infty$ defined to be $1$.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Young's Inequality}
	For $1<p<\infty$, $q$ the conjugate of $p$, and any two positive numbers $a$ and $b$,
	\[	
		ab\le\frac{a^p}{p}+\frac{b^q}{q}.
	\]
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	By convexity of the function $e^x$, we have
	\[
		ab=e^{ln(ab)}=e^{\frac{1}{p}ln(a^p)+\frac{1}{q}ln(b^q)}\le \frac{1}{p}e^{ln(a^p)}+\frac{1}{q}e^{ln(b^q)}=\frac{a^p}{p}+\frac{b^q}{q}.
	\]	
\end{proof}
\begin{namedthm*}{Theorem 1}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set, $1\le p<\infty$, and $q$ the conjugate of $p$.
	If $f$ belongs to $L^p(E)$ and $g$ belongs to $L^q(E)$, the their product $f\cdot g$ is integrable over $E$ and
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{H\"older's Inequality}
	\[
		\int_E|f\cdot g|\le\|f\|_p\cdot\|g\|_q.
	\]
	Moreover, if $f\neq0$, the function $f^*:=\|f\|_p^{1-p}\cdot\text{sgn}(f)\cdot|f|^{p-1}$ belongs to $L^q(E)$,
	\[
		\int_Ef\cdot f^*=\|f\|_p\quad\text{and}\quad\|f^*\|_q=1.
	\]
	(We define $\text{sgn}(f)(x):=1$ for $\{x\mid f(x)\ge0\}$ and $\text{sgn}(f)(x):=-1$ for $\{x\mid f(x)<0\}$.
	Therefore $\text{sgn}(f)\cdot f=|f|$ a.e. on $E$ since $f$ is finite a.e. on $E$.)
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	First consider the case $p=1$.
	Then $q=\infty$.
	By the definition of the essential supremum so that $|g|\le\|g\|_\infty$ a.e. on $E$, we have by the monotonicity of integration that
	\[
		\int_E|f\cdot g|\le\int_E|f|\cdot\|g\|_\infty=\|g\|_\infty\int_E|f|=\|g\|_\infty\cdot\|f\|_1.
	\]
	Also, $f^*=\|f\|_1^{1-1}\cdot\text{sgn}(f)\cdot|f|^{1-1}=\text{sgn}(f)$ so that 
	\[
		\int_Ef\cdot f^*=\int_E|f|=\|f\|_1\quad\text{and}\quad\|f^*\|_\infty=1.
	\]
	Now consider the case $p>1$, with $f\neq0$, $g\neq0$.
	It is clear that if H\"older's Inequality is true when $f$ is replaced by its normalization $f/\|f\|_p$ and $g$ is replaced by its normalization $g/\|g\|_q$, then it is true for $f$ and $g$ (See problem 6).
	We therefore assume that $\|f\|_p=1$ and $\|g\|_q=1$, in which case H\"older's Inequality becomes
	\[
		\int_E|f\cdot g|\le 1.
	\]
	Since $|f|^p$ and $|g|^q$ are integrable over $E$, then $g$ and $g$ are finite a.e. on $E$.
	Thus, by Young's Inequality,
	\[
		|f\cdot g|=|f|\cdot|g|\le\frac{|f|^p}{p}+\frac{|g|^q}{q}\text{ a.e. on }E.
	\]
	We infer from the linearity of integration and the integral comparison test that $f\cdot g$ is integrable over $E$ and, by the monotonicity and linearity of integration, that
	\[
		\int_E|f\cdot g|\le\frac{1}{p}\int_E|f|^p+\frac{1}{q}\int_E|g|^q=\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1.
	\]
	Now observe that 
	\[
		f\cdot f^*=f\cdot\|f\|_p^{1-p}\cdot \text{sgn}(f)\cdot|f|^{p-1}=\|f\|_p^{1-p}|f|^p\text{ a.e. on }E.
	\]
	Therefore
	\[
		\int_Ef\cdot f^*=\|f\|_p^{1-p}\int_E|f|^p=\|f\|_p^{1-p}\|f\|_p^p=\|f\|_p,
	\]
	and because $q=\frac{p}{p-1}$, we have
	\[
		\|f^*\|_q
		=\left(\int_E|\ \|f\|_p^{1-p}\text{sgn}(f)|f|^{p-1}\ |^{q}\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}
		=\|f\|_p^{1-p}\left(\int_E|f|^p\right)^{\frac{1}{p}(p-1)}
		=\|f\|_p^{1-p}\|f\|_p^{p-1}
		=1.
	\]
\end{proof}
\begin{namedthm*}{Minkowski's Inequality}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1\le p\le\infty$.
	If the functions $f$ and $g$ belong to $L^p(E)$, then so does their sum $f+g$ and, moreover,
	\[
		\|f+g\|_p\le\|f\|_p+\|g\|_p.
	\]
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	We already considered the cases $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
	Assume $1<p<\infty$.
	We infer from 7.1 that $f+g$ belongs to $L^p(E)$.
	Suppose $f+g\neq0$.
	Then by H\"older's Inequality,
	\[
		\|f+g\|_p
		=\int_E(f+g)(f+g)^*
		=\int_Ef(f+g)^*+\int_Eg(f+g)^*
		\le\|f\|_p\|(f+g)^*\|_q+\|g\|_p\|(f+g)^*\|_q
		=\|f\|_p+\|g\|_q.
	\]
\end{proof}
\begin{namedthm*}{Corollary 3}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set of finite measure and $1\le p_1<p_2\le\infty$.
	Then $L^{p_2}(E)\subseteq L^{p_1}(E)$.
	Furthermore,
	\[
		\|f\|_{p_1}\le c\|f\|_{p_2}\text{ for all }f\in L^{p_2}(E),
	\]
	where $c=[m(E)]^{\frac{p_2-p_1}{p_1p_2}}$ if $p_2<\infty$ and $c=[m(E)]^{\frac{1}{p_1}}$ if $p_2=\infty$.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	The case $p_2=\infty$ is left as an exercise.
	Assume $p<\infty$.
	Observe that $f^{p_1}$ belongs to $L^{p_2/p_1}(E)$ and $\chi_E$ belongs to $L^{1-{p_1/p_2}}(E)$ because $m(E)<\infty$.
	Then by H\"older's Inequality,
	\[
		\|f\|_{p_1}^{p_1}
		=\int_E|f|^{p_1}
		=\int_E|f|^{p_1}\chi_E
		\le\left(\int_E|\ |f|^{p_1}\ |^{p_2/p_1}\right)^{p_1/p_2}\left(\int_E|\chi_E|^{\frac{1}{1-p_1/p_2}}\right)^{1-{p_1/p_2}}
		=\|f\|_{p_2}^{p_1}\cdot[m(E)]^{\frac{p_2-p_1}{p_2}}.
	\]
	Therefore $\|f\|_{p_1}\le \|f\|_{p_2}\cdot[m(E)]^{\frac{p_2-p_1}{p_1p_2}}$, so that 
	\[
		\|f\|_{p_2}<\infty\implies \|f\|_{p_1}<\infty,
	\]
	which gives us $L^{p_2}(E)\subseteq L^{p_1}(E)$.
\end{proof}
In general, for $E$ of infinite measure, there are no inclusion relationships among the $L^p(E)$ spaces.

\section{$L^p$ is Complete: The Riesz-Fischer Theorem}
\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
	A sequence $\{f_n\}$ in a linear space $X$ that is normed by $\|\cdot\|$ is said to \textbf{converge to $f$ in $X$} provided
	\[
		\lim_{n\to\infty}\|f-f_n\|=0.
	\]
	We write 
	\[
		\{f_n\}\to f\text{ in }X\text{ or }\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n=f\text{ in }X
	\]
	to mean that each $f_n$ and $f$ belong to $X$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\|f-f_n\|=0$.
\end{namedthm*}
For a sequence $\{f_n\}$ and a function $f$ in $C[a,b]$, $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $C[a,b]$, normed by the maximum norm, iff $\{f_n\}\to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.

For a sequence $\{f_n\}$ and a function $f$ in $L^\infty(E)$, $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^\infty(E)$ iff $\{f_n\}\to f$ uniformly on the complement of a set of measure zero.

For a sequence $\{f_n\}$ and a function $f$ in $L^p(E)$, $1\le p<\infty$, $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^p(E)$ iff $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_E|f_n-f|^p=0.$
\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
	A sequence $\{f_n\}$ in a linear space $X$ that is normed by $\|\cdot\|$ is said to be \textbf{Cauchy} in $X$ provided for each $\epsilon>0$, there is a natural number $N$ such that
	\[
		\|f_n-f_m\|<\epsilon\text{ for all }m,n\ge N.
	\]
	A normed linear space $X$ is said to be \textbf{complete} provided every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges to a function in $X$.
	A complete normed linear space is called a \textbf{Banach space}.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Proposition 4}
	Let $X$ be a normed linear space.
	Then every convergent sequence in $X$ is Cauchy.
	Moreover, a Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges if it has a convergent subsequence.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $X$.
	By the triangle inequality of the norm,
	\[
		\|f_n-f_m\|=\|f_n-f+f-f_m\|\le\|f_n-f\|+\|f-f_m\|\text{ for all }m,n.
	\]
	Therefore $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy.

	Now let $\{f_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence in $X$ that has a subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$ which converges in $X$ to $f$.
	Let $\epsilon>0$.
	Since $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy, there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\|f_n-f_m\|<\epsilon/2$ for all $n,m\ge N$.
	Then, since $\{f_{n_k}\}$ converges to $f$ we can choose $k$ such that $n_k>N$ so that $\|f_{n_k}-f\|<\epsilon/2$.
	Therefore we have
	\[
		\|f_n-f\|=\|f_n-f_{n_k}+f_{n_k}-f\|\le\|f_n-f_{n_k}\|+\|f_{n_k}-f\|<\epsilon/2+\epsilon/2\text{ for }n\ge N.
	\]
	Therefore $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $X$.
\end{proof}
\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
	Let $X$ be a linear space normed by $\|\cdot\|$.
	A sequence $\{f_n\}$ in $X$ is said to be \textbf{rapidly Cauchy} provided there is a convergent series of positive numbers $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k$ for which 
	\[
		\|f_{k+1}-f_k\|\le\epsilon_k^2\text{ for all }k.
	\]
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Proposition 5}
	Let $X$ be a normed linear space.
	Then every rapidly Cauchy sequence in $X$ is Cauchy.
	Furthermore, every Cauchy sequence has a rapidly Cauchy subsequence.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\{f_n\}$ be a rapidly Cauchy sequence in $X$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k$ a convergent series of positive numbers for which 
	\[
		\|f_{k+1}-f_k\|\le\epsilon_k^2\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	We have by telescoping, 
	\[
		f_{n+k}-f_n=\sum_{j=n}^{n+k-1}[f_{j+1}-f_j]\text{ for all }n,k,
	\]
	and therefore by subadditivity of the norm,
	\[
		\|f_{n+k}-f_n\|=\sum_{j=n}^{n+k-1}\|f_{j+1}-f_j\|\le\sum_{j=n}^{n+k-1}\epsilon_j^2\le\sum_{j=n}^\infty\epsilon_j^2\text{ for all }n,k.
	\]
	For $\varepsilon_1=1>0$, there exists $N_1\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum_{j=p}^\infty\epsilon_j<1$ for all $p\ge N_1$.
	This implies $0<\epsilon_j<1$ for each $j\ge p$, which gives us $\epsilon_j^2<\epsilon_j$ so that $\sum_{j=p}^\infty\epsilon_j^2<\sum_{j=p}^\infty\epsilon_j<\infty$, which implies that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty\epsilon_j^2$ is a convergent series of positive numbers.
	
	Fix $\varepsilon_2>0$.
	Then because $\sum_{j=1}^\infty\epsilon_j^2$ is convergent, there exists an index $N_2\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\ge N_2$, then 
	\[
		\|f_{n+k}-f_n\|\le\sum_{j=n}^\infty\epsilon_j^2=\sum_{j=1}^\infty\epsilon_j^2-\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\epsilon_j^2<\varepsilon_2\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	Therefore $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy.

	Now assume that $\{f_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X$.
	\\\underline{Base case: $P(1)$}:
	\\Because $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy, there exists an index $N$ such that for $n_1,n_2\ge N$ with $n_1<n_2$, then 
	\[
		\|f_{n_2}-f_{n_1}\|\le\frac{1}{2^3}<\frac{1}{2^1},
	\]
	and for all $n\ge n_{2}$, we have
	\[
		\|f_{n_2}-f_n\|<\frac{1}{2^3}.
	\]
	\underline{Inductive hypothesis: Suppose $P(k)$}: 
	\\suppose that we already have $n_1,\dots,n_k$ such that
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k}}-f_{n_{k-1}}\|<1/2^{k-1},
	\]
	and for all $n\ge n_{k}$, we have
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k}}-f_{n}\|<1/2^{k+1}.\tag{1}
	\]
	\underline{$P(k+1)$}:
	\\Because $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy, there exists an index $N$ such that for $m,n\ge N$, then 
	\[
		\|f_m-f_n\|<1/2^{k+2}.\tag{2}
	\]
	Then choose $n_{k+1}>\max\{N,n_k\}$ so that by (2) and (1), for all $n\ge n_{k+1}$ we have
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k+1}}-f_{n_{k}}\|\le\|f_{n_{k+1}}-f_n\|+\|f_n-f_{n_{k}}\|\le\frac{1}{2^{k+2}}+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}=(\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{2})\cdot\frac{1}{2^{k}}\le\frac{1}{2^{k}},
	\]
	and because $n_{k+1}\ge N$, for all $n\ge n_{k+1}$ we have
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k+1}}-f_{n}\|<1/2^{k+2}.
	\]
	Therefore we have shown that we can inductively choose a strictly increasing sequence $\{n_k\}$ such that 
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k+1}}-f_{n_k}\|\le\frac{1}{2^k}\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	and $\sqrt{2^k}=(2^k)^{1/2}=\sqrt{2}^k$ for each $k$ tells us that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^k}}=\sum_{k=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}})^k$, which converges because $\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|<1$.
	Therefore $\{f_{n_k}\}$ is rapidly Cauchy.
\end{proof}
\begin{namedthm*}{Theorem 6}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1\le p\le\infty$.
	Then every rapidly Cauchy sequence in $L^p(E)$ converges both w.r.t. the $L^p(E)$ norm and pointwise a.e. on $E$ to a function in $L^p(E)$.

	\textbf{PROBLEMS}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{22}
	\item Provide an example of a Cauchy sequence of real numbers that is not rapidly Cauchy.
	\item Let $X$ be a normed linear space.
	Assume that $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $X$, $\{g_n\}\to g$ in $X$, and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are real numbers.
	Show that
	\[
		\{\alpha f_n+\beta g_n\}\to\alpha f+\beta g\text{ in }X.
	\]
	\item Assume that $E$ has finite measure and $1\le p_1< p_2\le\infty$.
	Show that if $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^{p_2}(E)$, then $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^{p_1}(E)$.
	
	From Chapter 7.2 Corollary 3 we obtain that there exists $c>0$ where $\|f_n-f\|_{p_1}\le c\|f_n-f\|_{p_2}$, and because we have $\|f_n-f\|_{p_2}\to0$, we are done.
	\item (The $L^p$ Dominated Convergence Theorem) Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$.
	For $1\le p<\infty$, suppose there is a function $g$ in $L^p(E)$ such that for all $n$, $|f_n|\le g$ a.e. on $E$.
	Prove that $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^p(E)$.
	\item For $E$ a measurable set and $1\le p<\infty$, assume $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^p(E)$.
	Show that there is a subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$ and a function $g\in L^p(E)$ for which $|f_{n_k}|\le g$ a.e. on $E$ for all $k$.
	\item Assume $E$ has finite measure and $1\le p<\infty$.
	Suppose $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of measurable functions that converges pointwise a.e. on $E$ to $f$.
	For $1\le p<\infty$, show that $\{f_n\}\to f$ in $L^p(E)$ if there is a $\theta>0$ such that $\{f_n\}$ belongs to and is bounded as a subset of $L^{p+\theta}(E)$.
	\item Consider the linear space of polynomials on $[a,b]$ normed by $\|\cdot\|_{\max}$ norm.
	Is this normed linear space a Banach space?
	\item Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence in $C[a,b]$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ a convergent series of positive numbers such that
	\[
		\|f_{k+1}-f_k\|_{\max}\le a_k\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	Prove that
	\[
		|f_{n+k}(x)-f_n(x)|\le\|f_{n+k}-f_n\|_{\max}\le\sum_{j=n}^\infty a_j\text{ for all }k,n\text{ and all }x\in[a,b].
	\]
	Conclude that there is a function $f\in C[a,b]$ such that $\{f_n\}\to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	\item Use the preceding problem to show that $C[a,b]$, normed by the maximum norm, is a Banach space.\\
	\\Note: See Chapter 16 Problem 1 that $C[a,b]$ normed by the $L^2[a,b]$ norm is not a Banach space.
	In particular, we had a sequence of continuous functions in $[a,b]$ that was Cauchy (w.r.t. the $L^2$ norm ) but converged ($L^2$) to a discontinuous function in $[a,b]$.
	We again consider this sequence of functions $\{f_n\}$ and now show that it is no longer Cauchy (w.r.t. the maximum norm) and thus does not converge.
	Recall the definition of each function:
	\[
        f_n(x):=
        \begin{cases}
            0 &x\le t\\
            n(x-t)&t<x<t+\frac{1}{n}\\
            1 &x\ge t+\frac{1}{n}
        \end{cases}
    \]
	Fix $\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}$.
	For any $N\in\mathbb{N}$, consider $n\ge N$ and $m=3n>n\ge N$. 
	\\Then we have
	\[
        (f_m-f_n)(x)=
        \begin{cases}
            0-0 &x\le t\\
            m(x-t)-n(x-t)&x\in(t,t+\frac{1}{m})\\
            1-n(x-t)&x\in[t+\frac{1}{m},t+\frac{1}{n})\\
            1-1 &x\ge t+\frac{1}{n}
        \end{cases}
	\]
	then we can clearly see that the maximum occurs at $t+\frac{1}{m}$ so that 
	\[
		\|f_m-f_n\|_{\max}=\max_{x\in[a,b]}|(f_m-f_n)(x)|=1-n((t+\frac{1}{m})-t)=1-\frac{n}{3n}=\frac{2}{3}>\frac{1}{2},
	\]
	and the sequence is not Cauchy.\\
	\\Back to the proof of Problem 31:
	\\Consider the linear space $C[a,b]$ with the maximum norm. 
	Suppose that $\{f_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence of functions in this space.
	By Proposition 5, there exists a rapidly Cauchy subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$.
	That is, there is a convergent series of positive numbers $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k$ for which
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k+1}}-f_{n_k}\|_{\max}\le\epsilon_k^2\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	Then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k$ converges implies that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k^2$ also converges.
	\\Therefore by the previous Problem 30, there is a function $f\in C[a,b]$ such that $\{f_{n_k}\}\to f$ uniformly on $[a,b]$.
	Then by Proposition 4, $\{f_n\}$ converges because it has a convergent subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$. 
	\item Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence in $L^\infty(E)$ and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ a convergent series of positive numbers such that
	\[
		\|f_{k+1}-f_k\|_{\infty}\le a_k\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	Prove that there is a subset $E_0$ of $E$ which has measure zero and 
	\[
		|f_{n+k}(x)-f_n(x)|\le\|f_{n+k}-f_n\|_{\infty}\le\sum_{j=n}^\infty a_j\text{ for all }k,n\text{ and all }x\in E\setminus E_0.
	\]
	Conclude that there is a function $f\in L^\infty(E)$ such that $\{f_n\}\to f$ uniformly on $E\setminus E_0$.
	\item Use the preceding problem to show that $L^\infty(E)$ is a Banach space.\\
	\\Consider the linear space $L^\infty(E)$ with the supremum norm. 
	Suppose that $\{f_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence of functions in this space.
	By Proposition 5, there exists a rapidly Cauchy subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$.
	That is, there is a convergent series of positive numbers $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k$ for which
	\[
		\|f_{n_{k+1}}-f_{n_k}\|_{\infty}\le\epsilon_k^2\text{ for all }k.
	\]
	Then $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k$ converges implies that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\epsilon_k^2$ also converges.
	\\Therefore by the previous Problem 32, there is a function $f\in L^\infty(E)$ and a set $E_0\subseteq E$ of measure zero such that $\{f_{n_k}\}\to f$ uniformly on $E\setminus E_0$.
	Then by Proposition 4, $\{f_n\}$ converges because it has a convergent subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$. 
	\item Prove that for $1\le p\le\infty$, $\ell^p$ is a Banach space.
	\item Show that the space $c$ of all convergent sequences of real numbers and the space $c_0$ of all sequences that converge to zero are Banach spaces w.r.t. the $\ell^\infty$ norm.

\section{Approximation and Separability}

\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
	Let $X$ be a normed linear space with norm $\|\cdot\|$.
	Given two subsets $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of $X$ with $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is \textbf{dense} in $\mathcal{G}$ provided for each function $g$ in $\mathcal{G}$ and $\epsilon>0$, there is a function $f$ in $\mathcal{F}$ for which $\|f-g\|<\epsilon$.
\end{namedthm*}
It is clear that $\mathcal{F}$ is dense in $\mathcal{G}$ iff for each $g$ in $\mathcal{G}$ there is a sequence $\{f_n\}$ in $\mathcal{F}$ for which 
\[
	\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n=g\text{ in }X.
\]	
Moreover, it is also useful to observe that for $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathcal{G}\subseteq X$,
\[
	\text{if }\mathcal{F}\text{ is dense in }\mathcal{G}\text{ and }\mathcal{G}\text{ is dense in }\mathcal{H},\text{ then }\mathcal{F}\text{ is dense in }\mathcal{H}.
\]

The rational numbers are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, as are the irrational numbers.
The Weierstrass Approximation Theorem tells us that the family of polynomials restricted to $[a,b]$ is dense in the linear space $C[a,b]$, normed by the maximum norm.

\begin{namedthm*}{Proposition 9}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1\le p\le\infty$.
	Then the subspace of simple functions in $L^p(E)$ is dense in $L^p(E)$.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Proposition 10}
	Let $[a,b]$ be a closed, bounded interval and $1\le p<\infty$.
	Then the subspace of step functions on $[a,b]$ is dense in $L^p[a,b]$.
\end{namedthm*}
(To prove proposition 10, it suffices to show that the step functions are dense in the simple functions, with respect to the $\|\cdot\|_p$ norm.)
\begin{namedthm*}{Definition}
	A normed linear space $X$ is said to be \textbf{separable} provided there is a countable subset that is dense in $X$.

The real numbers are separable since the rational numbers are a countable dense subset.
For $[a,b]$ a closed, bounded interval, $C[a,b]$, normed by the maximum norm, is separable since we infer from the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem that the polynomials with rational coefficients are a countable set that is dense in $C[a,b]$.
\begin{namedthm*}{Theorem 11}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1\le p<\infty$.
	Then the normed linear space $L^p(E)$ is separable.
\end{namedthm*}
In general $L^\infty(E)$ is not separable.
\begin{namedthm*}{Theorem 12}
	Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1\le p<\infty$.
	Then $C_c(E)$ is dense in $L^p(E)$, where $C_c(E)$ denotes the linear space of continuous real-valued functions on $E$ that vanish outside a bounded set.

(
	We know that a closed subset $E$ of a Banach space $X$ is also Banach itself: 
	consider a Cauchy sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $E$. 
	Then it is a Cauchy sequence in $X$, and thus by completeness of $X$, it converges to an element $x$ in $X$.
	However, because $E$ is closed, it contains all its limit points and thus $x$ is also in $E$.

	\item Let $E$ be a measurable set of finite measure and $1\le p_1<p_2<\infty$.
	Consider the linear space $L^{p_2}(E)$ normed by $\|\cdot\|_{p_1}$.
	Is this normed linear space a Banach space?
	
	% From the Riesz-Fischer Theorem of Chapter 7.3, we have that the space $L^{p_1}$ is a Banach space.
	Recall from Chapter 7.2 Corollary 3, we have that $L^{p_2}\subset L^{p_1}$ and $\|f\|_{p_1}\le c\|f\|_{p_2}$ for $f\in L^{p_2}$.
	Therefore it is justified to consider the normed linear space $(L^{p_2},\|\cdot\|_{p_1})$.
	Consider the counterexample with $(L^2,\|\cdot\|_1)$:
	Let $f:(0,1)\to\mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x):=x^{-1/2}$.
	Then 
	\begin{align*}
		\|f\|_1&=\int_0^1x^{-1/2}dx=2\quad\implies f\in L^1,\\
		\|f\|_2&=\int_0^1x^{-2}dx=\infty\quad\implies f\notin L^2.
	\end{align*}
	We may consider the sequence $f_n(x):=\min\{f(x),n\}$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
	Because each function $f_n$ is bounded, then we have each $f_n\in L^\infty\subset L^2\subset L^1$.
	Then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{(0,1)}f_n=\int_{(0,1)}f$.
	This implies convergence in $L^1$ and thus the sequence $\{f_n\}$ is Cauchy in $(L^2,\|\cdot\|_1)$.
	However, the limit $f$ is not in $L^2$, and thus $(L^2,\|\cdot\|_1)$ is not a Banach space.

	\item
	\item Suppose that $X$ is a Banach space with norm $\|\cdot\|$.
	Let $X_0$ be a dense subspace of $X$.
	Assume that $X_0$, when normed by the norm it inherits from $X$, is also a Banach space.
	Prove that $X=X_0$.

	Because $X_0$ is already a subset of $X$, it is sufficient to prove that $X\subset X_0$.
	Consider any $x\in X$.
	Then because $X_0$ is dense in $X$, then we may find a sequence $\{x_n\}_n$ in $X_0$ that converges to $x$ w.r.t. the norm $\|\cdot\|$.
	Then we know by the triangle inequality that this sequence $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy in $X_0$.
	However, because $X_0$ is a Banach space, then every Cauchy sequence (in $X_0$) converges to an element in the space ($X_0$).
	Therefore $x$ must be in $X_0$, and we have $X\subset X_0$.
