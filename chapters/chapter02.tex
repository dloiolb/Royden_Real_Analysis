\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we construct a collection of sets called \textbf{Lebesgue measurable sets}, and a set function of this collection called \textbf{Lebesgue measure}, denoted by $m$. 
(A \textit{set function} is a function that associates an extended real number to each set in a collection of sets.)
The collection of Lebesgue measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra which contains all open sets and all closed sets. The set function $m$ possesses the following three properties:
\begin{namedthm*}{The measure of an interval is its length}
Each nonempty interval $I$ is Lebesgue measurable and 
\[
m(I) = \ell(I).
\]
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Measure is translation invariant}
If $E$ is Lebesgue measurable and $y$ is any number then the translate of $E$ by $y$, $E+y = \{x+y \ |\ x \in E\}$, also is Lebesgue measurable and
\[
m(E+y) = m(E).
\]
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Measure is countably additive over countable disjoint unions of sets}
If $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ is a countable disjoint collection of Lebesgue measurable sets, then
\[
m(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(E_k).
\]
\end{namedthm*}
It is not possible to construct a set function that possesses the above three properties and is defined for all sets of real numbers (See Vitali sets).
We first construct a set function called \textbf{outer measure}, denoted by $m^*$, such that: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),align=left]
	\item the outer measure of an interval is its length:
	\[
		m^*(I)=\ell(I).
	\]
	\item outer measure is translation invariant:
	\[
		m^*(A+y)=m^*(A).
	\]
	\item outer measure is countably subadditive:
	\[
		m(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(E_k).
	\]
\end{enumerate}
Outer measure is defined for all sets of real numbers.
However, outer measure fails to be countably additive: there exists $A,B$ disjoint s.t. $m^*(A\cup B)<m^*(A)+m^*(B)$.\\
Then the Lebesgue measure $m$ is the restriction of $m^*$ to the Lebesgue measurable sets.

\begin{center}
	\textbf{PROBLEMS}
\end{center}
In the first three problems, let $m$ be a set function defined for all sets in a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with values in $[0,\infty]$. Assume $m$ is countably additive over countable disjoint collections of sets in $\mathcal{A}$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{0}
	\item Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are two sets in $\mathcal{A}$ with $A \subseteq B$, then $m(A) \le m(B)$. This property is called \textit{monotonicity}.\par
	$A \subseteq B \implies B = A \cup (B \cap A^c),$ where $A \cap (B \cap A^c) = \emptyset$. The set $(B \cap A^c)$ is measurable because $A^c$ is measurable and countable intersection is measurable, so $m(B) = m(A \cup (B \cap A^c)) = 	m(A) + m(B \cap A^c)$ by countable additivity, and thus $m(B) \ge m(A)$.
	\item Prove that if there is a set $A$ in the collection $\mathcal{A}$ for which $m(A) < \infty$, then $m(\emptyset) = 0$.\par
	We have $A\cap\emptyset = \emptyset$ and $A\cup\emptyset = A$. 
    \begin{align*}
        m(A)&=m(A\cup\emptyset)\\
        m(A)&=m(A)+m(\emptyset)&&\text{ by disjoint additivity}\\
        0&=m(\emptyset).
    \end{align*}
	\item Let $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$. Prove that $m(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty m(E_k).$
    For any two measurable sets $A,B$, we have $A\cup B=(A\setminus B)\cup(B)$.
    By disjoint additivity,
    \[
        m(A\cup B) = m(A\setminus B)+m(B)
    \]
    Now, by problem 1, $(A\setminus B)\subseteq A$ implies that $m(A\setminus B)\le m(A)$.
    Therefore
    \[
        m(A\cup B) \le m(A)+m(B).
    \]
    \item A set function $c$, defined on all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, is defined as follows.
	Define $c(E)$ to be $\infty$ if $E$ has infinitely many members and $c(E)$ to be equal to the number of elements in $E$ if $E$ is finite; define $c(\emptyset)=0$. Show that $c$ is a countably additive and translation invariant set function. This set function is called the \textbf{counting measure}.\\
    Suppose $E=\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$.\\
    Then $m(E)=n$. For any real number $y$, $y+E = \{y+x_1,\cdots,y+x_n\}$, so $m(y+E)=n$.\\
    Suppose $E$ has infinitely many members.\\
    Then $y+E$ has infinitely members as well, so $m(E)=m(y+E)=\infty$.\\
    Let $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be a disjoint collection of sets of real numbers.
    In the case that there exists an $E_k$ with infinitely many members, then the countable additivity is clear.
    \\In the case that all sets $E_k$ are finite, for any two sets $E_i,E_j$:\\
    $E_i = \{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$\\
    $E_j = \{y_1,\cdots,y_m\}$\\  
    Then $E_i\cup E_j = \{x_1,\cdots,x_n,y_1,\cdots,y_m\}$ and $m(E_i\cup E_j)=n+m=m(E_i) +m(E_j)$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lebesgue Outer Measure}
\begin{flushleft}

Let $I$ be a nonempty interval of real numbers. We define its length:
\[
	\ell(I)=
	\begin{cases}
		\infty&\text{if $I$ is unbounded}\\
		b-a&\text{endpoints $a,b$}
	\end{cases}	
\]
For a set $A$ of real numbers, consider the countable collections $\{I_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ of nonempty open, bounded intervals that cover $A$; that is, collections for which $A\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$.
For each such collection, consider the sum of the lengths of the intervals in the collection. Since the lengths are positive numbers, each sum is uniquely defined independently of the order of the terms.
We define the \textbf{outer measure} of $A$, $m^*(A)$, to be the infimum of all such sums, that is
\[
	m^*(A)=\inf\biggl\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)\ \biggl|\ A\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\biggr\}.
\]
It follows immediately from the definition of outer measure that $m^*(\emptyset)=0$.
Moreover, since any cover of a set $B$ is also a cover of any subset of $B$, outer measure is \textbf{monotone} in the sense that
\[
	A\subseteq B\implies m^*(A)\le m^*(B).	
\]
Then because $\emptyset\subseteq A$ for any set $A$, we have $0=m^*(\emptyset)\le m^*(A)$.
\begin{namedthm*}{Example}
	A countable set $C$ has outer measure zero.\\
	Because $C$ is countable, enumerate $C$ such that $C=\{c_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$.
	Fix $\epsilon>0$. 
	For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$, define an open interval $I_k= (c_k-\frac{\epsilon}{2^{k+1}},c_k+\frac{\epsilon}{2^{k+1}})$.
	Then $C\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$.
	Therefore we have, by definition of infimum,
	\[
	0\le m^*(C)\le\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{2\epsilon}{2^{k+1}} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{\epsilon}{2^k}=\epsilon.
	\]
	This inequality holds for each $\epsilon>0$; thus $m^*(C)=0$.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{namedthm*}{Lemma}
	$\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^k}=1$.
\end{namedthm*}
\begin{proof}
	To show that $\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^k}=1-\frac{1}{2^n}$ (induction).\\
	Let $P(n)$ be the assertion that $\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^k}=1-\frac{1}{2^n}$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$.\\
	$P(1)$:
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{k=1}^1\frac{1}{2^k}=\frac{1}{2}=1-\frac{1}{2^1}.
	\end{align*}
	$P(2)$:
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{k=1}^2\frac{1}{2^k}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}=1-\frac{1}{2^2}.
	\end{align*}
	Suppose $P(m)$ is true for $m\ge1$; that is, $\sum_{k=1}^m\frac{1}{2^k}=1-\frac{1}{2^m}$.\\
	$P(m+1)$:
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{k=1}^{m+1}\frac{1}{2^k}&=\sum_{k=1}^m\frac{1}{2^k}+\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\\
		&=1-\frac{1}{2^m}+\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\\
		&=1-\frac{2}{2^{m+1}}+\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\\
		&=1-\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}.
	\end{align*}
	Therefore $P(m)$ is true for all $m\ge1$.
	\[
		\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^k}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{2^k}=\lim_{n\to\infty}(1-\frac{1}{2^n})=1.
	\]
	\\(An alternate proof would be to see that we have a sequence of partial sums that is monotonic with $1$ as the supremum. Then the sequence of partial sums converges to $1$ and the series is summable to $1$.)
\end{proof}

\end{flushleft}
\begin{center}
	\textbf{PROBLEMS}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{4}
	\item By using properties of outer measure, prove that the interval $[0,1]$ is not countable.\\
	Suppose that the interval $[0,1]$ is countable. By an example above, we showed that a countable set has outer measure zero, so $m^*([0,1])=0$.
	Also, the outer measure of an interval is its length. Then $m^*([0,1])=1$, and we reach a contradiction.
	\item Let $A$ be the set of irrational numbers in the interval $[0,1]$. Prove that $m^*(A)=1$.\\
	Let $A=[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}^c$.\\
	Then $A\subseteq[0,1]$, so by monotonicity of outer measure, 
	\begin{align*}
		m^*(A)&\le m^*([0,1])\\
		m^*(A)&\le 1.
	\end{align*}
	Also, we have 
	\begin{align*}
		[0,1]&=([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}^c)\cup([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q})\\
		[0,1]&=A\cup([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q})\\
		[0,1]&\subseteq A\cup([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q})&&A=B\implies A\subseteq B\text{ and }A\supseteq B\\
		m^*([0,1])&\le m^*(A\cup (m^*([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}))&&\text{by monotonicity}\\
		m^*([0,1])&\le m^*(A)+m^*([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q})&&\text{by countable subadditvity}\\
		m^*([0,1])&\le m^*(A)+0&&\text{countable set has outer measure zero}\\
		1&\le m^*(A).&&\text{outer measure of interval is length}
	\end{align*}
	Then $m^*(A)\le 1$ and $1\le m^*(A)$ imply that $m^*(A)=1$.
	\item A set of real numbers is said to be a $G_\delta$ set provided it is the intersection of a countable collection of open sets.
	Show that for any bounded set $E$, there is a $G_\delta$ set $G$ for which
	\[E\subseteq G \ \text{and}\ m^*(G)=m^*(E).\]
	Suppose $E$ is a bounded set of real numbers.\\
	Then there exists a real number $M$ for which $|x|\le M$ for all $x\in E$; that is, $E\subseteq[-M,M]$.
	By monotonicity of outer measure, $m^*(E)\le m^*([-M,M])=2M<\infty$, and the outer measure of $E$ is finite.\\
	Now, because outer measure is defined as $m^*(E)=\inf\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)\ |\ E\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\}$, we have that $m^*(E)$ is the greatest lower bound, so for a natural number $n$, $m^*(E)+\frac{1}{n}$ is not a lower bound.
	That is, there exists a countable sequence of open sets $\{(I_n)_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ such that $E\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (I_n)_k$ and 
	\begin{equation}
		m^*(E)\le\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell((I_n)_k)<m^*(E)+\frac{1}{n}.\tag{1}
	\end{equation}
	Now, for each natural number $n$, we can define the open set
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{O}_n:=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (I_n)_k.\tag{2}
	\end{equation}
	Also define the countable intersection of open sets; i.e., a $G_\delta$ set:
	\[
		\mathcal{O}:=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{O}_n.
	\]
	Then because we have $E\subseteq\mathcal{O}_n$ for every $n$, this implies $E\subseteq\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{O}_n=\mathcal{O}$.
	\begin{align*}
		m^*(E)&\le m^*(\mathcal{O})&&\text{by monotonicity of outer measure: }E\subseteq\mathcal{O}\\
		&\le m^*(\mathcal{O}_n)&&\text{by monotonicity of outer measure: }\mathcal{O}=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{O}_n\subseteq\mathcal{O}_n\\
		&=m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty (I_n)_k)&&\text{by (2)}\\
		&\le\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell((I_n)_k)&&\text{by countable subadditivity of outer measure}\\
		&<m^*(E)+\frac{1}{n}.&&\text{by (1)}
	\end{align*}
	Therefore for any natural number $n$,
	\[
		m^*(E)\le m^*(\mathcal{O})<m^*(E)+\frac{1}{n}.	
	\]
	Taking the limit as $n\to\infty$, we get that $m^*(E)= m^*(\mathcal{O})$.\\
	Therefore there exists a $G_\delta$ set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $E\subseteq \mathcal{O}$ and $m^*(E)= m^*(\mathcal{O})$.
	\item Let $B$ be the set of rational numbers in the interval $[0,1]$, and let $\{I_k\}_{k=1}^n$ be a finite collection of open intervals that covers $B$.
	Prove that $\textstyle \sum_{k=1}^n m^*(I_k) \ge 1$.\\
	The rational numbers are dense in the reals; that is, between any two real numbers, there exists a rational number.
	Therefore, the rational numbers are also dense in the real subset $[0,1]$: between any two numbers in $[0,1]$, there exists a rational number. \\
	In the case that $[0,1]\subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k$, the inequality is clear by monotonicity and subadditivity: 
	\[
		1=m^*([0,1])\le m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k)\le\sum_{k=1}^nm^*(I_k).
	\]
	In the case that $[0,1]\not \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k$, then \[(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k)^c\cap[0,1]=(\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c)\cap[0,1]=\bigcap_{k=1}^n(I_k^c\cap[0,1])\neq\emptyset.\]
	\\We want to show that $\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c\cap[0,1]$ is countable so that $m^*(\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c\cap[0,1])=0$.\\
	Because each $I_k^c\cap[0,1]$ is a closed interval (of irrational numbers), the intersection is also a closed interval (nonempty by assumption); that is, $\bigcap_{k=1}^n(I_k^c\cap[0,1])=[a,b]$ for some $a\le b$.
	Suppose by contradiction that $\bigcap_{k=1}^n(I_k^c\cap[0,1])$ is not countable. 
	Then we have that $a<b$.
	However, by density of the rationals, there exists a rational between $[a,b]$, leading to a contradiction.
	\\Therefore $\bigcap_{k=1}^n(I_k^c\cap[0,1])=\{x\}$, where $x\in\mathbb{Q}^c$, and $\bigcap_{k=1}^n(I_k^c\cap[0,1])$ is countable.
	\\Now we can write
	\begin{align*}
		[0,1]&=(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1])\cup(\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c\cap[0,1])\\
		[0,1]&\subseteq(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1])\cup(\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c\cap[0,1])&&A=B\implies A\subseteq B\text{ and }A\supseteq B\\
		m^*([0,1])&\le m^*((\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1])\cup(\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c\cap[0,1]))&&\text{by monotonicity}\\
		m^*([0,1])&\le m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1])+m^*(\bigcap_{k=1}^nI_k^c\cap[0,1])&&\text{by countable subadditivity}\\
		m^*([0,1])&\le m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1])+0&&\text{the outer measure of a countable set is zero}\\
		1&\le m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1])\\
		1&\le m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k)&&\text{by monotonicity: }\bigcup_{k=1}^nI_k\cap[0,1]\subseteq[0,1]\\
		1&\le\sum_{k=1}^nm^*(I_k).&&\text{by countable subadditivity}
	\end{align*}
	\item Prove that if $m^*(A)=0$, then $m^*(A\cup B) = m^*(B)$.
	\begin{align*}
		m^*(A\cup B)&\le m^*(A)+m^*(B)&&\text{by countable subadditivity}\\
		m^*(A\cup B)&\le m^*(B)&&\text{because }m^*(A)=0.
	\end{align*}
	Also, we have $B\subseteq A\cup B$, so by monotonicity of outer measure,
	\begin{align*}
		m^*(B)&\le m^*(A\cup B).
	\end{align*}
	Then $m^*(A\cup B)\le m^*(B)$ and $m^*(B)\le m^*(A\cup B)$ imply that $m^*(A\cup B) = m^*(B)$.
	\item Let $A$ and $B$ be bounded sets for which there is an $\alpha >0$ such that $|a-b| \ge \alpha$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$.
	Prove that $m^*(A \cup B) = m^*(A)+m^*(B)$.\\
	By countable subadditivity of outer measure, $m^*(A \cup B) \le m^*(A)+m^*(B)$.\\
	We can see that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint: Suppose by contradiction that $A,B$ are not disjoint. Then there exists a real number $x$ such that $x\in A$ and $x\in B$.
	But then $|x-x|=0<\alpha$, a contradiction.\\
	Let $\epsilon$ such that $\alpha/2>\epsilon>0$. By definition of outer measure and infimum, there exists a countable sequence of open sets $\{I_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ such that $(A\cup B)\subseteq\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k$ and 
	\begin{equation}
		m^*(A\cup B)\le\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)<m^*(A\cup B)+\epsilon.\tag{1}	
	\end{equation}
	Now, each $I_k$ is such that $A\cap I_k\neq\emptyset$ or $B\cap I_k\neq\emptyset$, but not both.\\
	To see this, suppose by contradiction that there exists an $I_k$ such that $A\cap I_k\neq\emptyset$ and $B\cap I_k\neq\emptyset$.
	Then there exists $a,b\in I_k$ such that $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.
	Without loss of generality, suppose that these are the closest two elements of $A$ and $B$, and suppose $a<b$. Then the interval $(a,b)$ contains no elements of $A$ or $B$, and $m^*(b-a)\ge\alpha>\alpha/2$.
	This is a contradiction to the fact that $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)$ is within $\alpha/2$ of $m^*(A\cup B)$.\\
	We can then separate $\{I_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ into two subsequences $\{(I_A)_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ and $\{(I_B)_j\}_{j=1}^\infty$ such that $A\subseteq\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty (I_A)_i$ and $B\subseteq\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty (I_B)_j$.
	Then because the sum is uniquely defined independently of the order of terms, $\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty\ell((I_A)_i)+\sum_{j=1}^\infty\ell((I_B)_j)$.\\
	Therefore we can write
	\begin{align*}
		m^*(A \cup B)&\le m^*(A)+m^*(B)&&\text{by countable subadditivity of outer measure}\\
		&\le m^*(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty (I_A)_i)+m^*(\bigcup_{j=1}^\infty (I_B)_j)&&\text{by monotonicity of outer measure}\\
		&\le \sum_{i=1}^\infty\ell((I_A)_i)+\sum_{j=1}^\infty\ell((I_B)_j)&&\text{by countable subadditivity of outer measure}\\
		&=\sum_{k=1}^\infty\ell(I_k)&&\text{rearranging the sum}\\
		&<m^*(A\cup B)+\epsilon&&\text{by (1)}
	\end{align*}
	Therefore for any $\epsilon$,
	\[
		m^*(A \cup B)\le m^*(A)+m^*(B)<m^*(A\cup B)+\epsilon,
	\]
	thus $m^*(A \cup B) = m^*(A)+m^*(B)$.

	\item Show that if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are measurable, then
	\[
		m(E_1\cup E_2)+m(E_1\cap E_2) = m(E_1)+m(E_2).	
	\]
	\item Show that the assumption that $m(B_1)<\infty$ is necessary in part (ii) of the theorem regarding continuity of measure.
	\item Let $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be a countable disjoint collection of measurable sets. Prove that for any set $A$, 
	\[
		m^*(A\cap\sum_{k=1}^\infty E_k)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(A\cap E_k).	
	\]
	\item Let $\mathcal{M}'$ be any $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and $m'$ a set function on $\mathcal{M}'$ which takes values in $[0,\infty]$, is countably additive, and such that $m'(\emptyset)=0$.
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),align=left]
		\item Show that $m'$ is finitely additive, monotone, countably monotone, and possesses the excision property.
		\item Show that $m'$ possesses the same continuity properties as Lebesgue measure.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Show that continuity of measure together with finite additivity of measure implies countable additivity of measure.

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*),align=left]
		\item Show that rational equivalence defines an equivalence relation on any set.
		\item Explicitly find a choice set for the rational equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Q}$.
		\item Define two numbers to be irrationally equivalent provided their difference is irrational or zero. Is this an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$? Is this an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Q}$?
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Show that any choice set for the rational equivalence relation on a set of positive outer measure must be countably infinite.
	\item Justify the assertion in the proof of Vitali's Theorem that it suffices to consider the case that $E$ is bounded.
	\item Does Lemma 16 remain true if $\Lambda$ is allowed to be finite or to be uncountably infinite? Does it remain true if $\Lambda$ is allowed to be unbounded?
	\item Let $E$ be a nonmeasurable set of finite outer measure. Show that there is a $G_\delta$ set $G$ that contains $E$ for which
	\[

\section{The Cantor Set and the Cantor-Lebesgue Function}
\begin{center}
	\textbf{PROBLEMS}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{33}
	\item Show that there is a continuous, strictly increasing function on the interval $[0,1]$ that maps a set of positive measure onto a set of measure zero.
	\item Let $f$ be an increasing function on the open interval $I$. For $x_0\in I$ show that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ iff there are sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ in $I$ such that for each $n$, $a_n<x_0<b_n$, and $\lim_{n\to\infty}[f(b_n)-f(a_n)]=0$.
	\item Let $f$ be a continuous function defined on $E$. Is it true that $f^{-1}(A)$ is always measurable if $A$ is measurable?
	\item Let the function $f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be Lipschitz; that is, there is a constant $c\ge0$ such that for all $u,v\in[a,b]$, $|f(u)-f(v)|\le c|u-v|$.
	Show that $f$ maps a set of measure zero onto a set of measure zero. Show that $f$ maps a $F_\sigma$ set onto an $F_\sigma$ set. Conclude that $f$ maps a measurable set to a measurable set.
	\item Let $F$ be the subset of $[0,1]$ constructed in the same manner as the Cantor set except that each of the intervals removed at the $n$th deletion stage has length $\alpha 3^{-n}$ with $0<\alpha<1$.
	Show that $F$ is a closed set, $[0,1]\setminus F$ is dense in $[0,1]$, and $m(F)=1-\alpha$. Such a set $F$ is called a generalized Cantor set.
	\item Show that there is an open set of real numbers that, contrary to intuition, has a boundary of positive measure. (Hint: consider the complement of the generalized Cantor set of the preceding problem.)
	\item A subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be \textbf{nowhere dense} in $\mathbb{R}$ provided that every open set $\mathcal{O}$ has a non-empty open subset that is disjoint from $A$. Show that the Cantor set is nowhere dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
	\item Show that a strictly increasing function that is defined on an interval has a continuous inverse.
	\item Let $f$ be a continuous function and $B$ be a Borel set. Show that $f^{-1}(B)$ is a Borel set. (Hint: the collection of sets $E$ for which $f^{-1}(E)$ is Borel is a $\sigma$-algebra containing the open sets.)
	\item Use the preceding two problems to show that a continuous strictly increasing function that is defined on an interval maps Borel sets to Borel sets.
