\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{0}
	\item Let $f$ be a nonnegative Lebesgue measurable function on $\mathbb{R}$. 
	For each Lebesgue measurable subset $E$ of $\mathbb{R}$, define $\mu(E) = \smallint_E f$, the Lebesgue integral of $f$ over $E$.
	Show that $\mu$ is a measure on the $\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.
	\item Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of a set $X$ and the set function $\mu : \mathcal{M} \to [0,\infty)$ be finitely additive.
	Prove that $\mu$ is a measure iff whenever $\{A_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ is an ascending sequence of sets in $\mathcal{M}$, then
	\[
	\mu \biggl ( \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k \biggr ) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mu(A_k).	
	\]
	\item Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of a set $X$. Formulate and establish a correspondent of the preceding problem for descending sequences of sets in $\mathcal{M}$.
	\item
