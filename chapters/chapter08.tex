    \item Verify (8).
    \item Prove Proposition 1.
    \item Let $T$ be a linear functional on a normed linear space $X$. Show that $T$ is bounded iff the continuity property (7) holds.
    \item A functional $T$ on a normed linear space $X$ is said to be Lipschitz provided there is a $c\ge0$ such that
    \[
        |T(g)-T(h)|\le c\|g-h\|\text{ for all }g,h\in X.  
    \]
    The infimum of such $c$'s is called the Lipschitz constant for $T$. Show that a linear functional is bounded iff it is Lipschitz, in which case its Lipschitz constant is $\|T\|_*$.
    \item Let $E$ be a measurable set and $1\le 0<\infty$. Show that the functions in $L^p(E)$ that vanish outside a bounded set are dense in $L^p(E)$. Show that this is false for $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.
    \item Establish the Riesz Representation Theorem in the case $p=1$ by first showing, in the notation of the proof of the theorem, that the function $\Phi$ is Lipschitz and therefore it is absolutely continuous. Then follow the $p>1$ proof.
    \item State and prove a Riesz Representation Theorem for the bounded linear functionals on $\ell^p$, $1\le p<\infty$.
    \item Let $c$ be the linear space of real sequences that converge to a real number and $c_0$ the subspace of $c$ comprising sequences that converge to $0$. Norm each of these linear spaces with the $\ell^\infty$ norm. Determine the dual space of $c$ and $c_0$.
    \item Let $[a,b]$ be a closed, bounded interval and $C[a,b]$ be normed by the maximum norm. Let $x_0$ belong to $[a,b]$. Define the linear functional $T$ on $C[a,b]$ by $T(f)=f(x_0)$. Show that $T$ is bounded and is given by Riemann-Stieltjes integration against a function of bounded variation.
    \item Let $f$ belong to $C[a,b]$. Show that there is a function $g$ that is of bounded variation on $[a,b]$ for which 
    \[
        \int_a^bfdg=\|f\|_{\max}\text{ and }TV(g)=1.  
    \]
    \item Let $[a,b]$ be a closed, bounded interval and $C[a,b]$ be normed by the maximum norm. Let $T$ be a bounded linear functional on $C[a,b]$.
    For $x\in[a,b]$, let $g_x$ be the member of $C[a,b]$ that is linear on $[a,x]$ and on $[x,b]$ with $g_x(a)=0,g_x(x)=x-a$ and $g_x(b)=x-a$. Define $\Phi(x)=T(g_x)$ for $x\in[a,b]$. Show that $\Phi$ is Lipschitz on $[a,b]$.
