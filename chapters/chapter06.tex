\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{60}
	\item Show that a real-valued function $\varphi$ on $(a,b)$ is convex iff for points $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ in $(a,b)$ and nonnegative numbers $\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_n$ such that $\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k=1$,
	\[
        \varphi \biggr ( \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k x_k \biggl ) \le \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k \varphi(x_k).   
    \]
    Use this to directly prove Jensen's Inequality for $f$ a simple function.
    \item Show that a continuous function on $(a,b)$ is convex iff
    \[
        \varphi(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2})\le\frac{\varphi(x_1)+\varphi(x_2)}{2}\text{ for all }x_1,x_2\in (a,b).  
    \]
    \item A function on a general interval $I$ is said to be convex provided it is continuous on $I$ and (38) holds for all $x_1,x_2\in I$.
    Is a convex function on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$ necessarily Lipschitz on $[a,b]$?
    \item Let $\varphi$ have a second derivative at each point in $(a,b)$.
    Show that $\varphi$ is convex iff $\varphi''$ is nonnegative.
    \item Suppose $a\ge 0$ and $b\ge 0$.
    Show that the function $\varphi(t)=(a+bt)^p$ is convex on $[0,\infty)$ for $1\le p < \infty$.
    \item For what functions $\varphi$ is Jensen's Inequality always an equality?
    \item State and prove a version of Jensen's Inequality on a general closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$.
    \item Let $f$ be integrable over $[0,1]$. Show that 
    \[
    \exp\biggl [\int_0^1f(x)dx\biggr ] \le \int_0^1 \exp(f(x))dx.   
    \]
    \item Let $\{\alpha_n\}$ be a sequence of nonnegative numbers whose sum is $1$ and $\{\zeta_n\}$ is a sequence of positive numbers. Show that
    \[
    \prod_{n=1}^\infty \zeta_n^{\alpha_n} \le \sum_{n=1}^\infty \alpha_n \zeta_n. 
    \]
    \item Let $g$ be a positive measurable function on $[0,1]$. Show that $\log(\int_0^1g(x)dx) \ge\int_0^1\log(g(x))dx$ whenever each side is defined.
    \item (Nemytskii) Let $\varphi$ be a continuous function on $\mathbb{R}$.
    Show that if there are constants for which (43) holds, then $\varphi\circ f$ is integrable over $[0,1]$ whenever $f$ is.
    Then show that if $\varphi\circ f$ is integrable over $[0,1]$ whenever $f$ is, then there are constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ for which (43) holds.
