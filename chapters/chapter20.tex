    \item Let $A\subset X$ and let $B$ be $\nu$-measurable subset of $Y$.
    If $A\times B$ is measurable w.r.t. the product measure $\mu\times\nu$, is $A$ necessarily measurable w.r.t. $\mu$?
    
    % No.

\section{Cumulative Distribution Functions and Borel Measures on $\mathbb{R}$}
For a bounded Lebesgue measurable function $f$ on $[a,b]$, denote the Lebesgue integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$ by $\int_{[a,b]}fdm$.
For a bounded function $f$ on $[a,b]$ whose set of discontinuities has Lebesgue measure zero, we proved that the Riemann integral $\int_a^bf(x)dx$ is defined and 
\[
    \int_{[a,b]}fdm=\int_a^bf(x)dx.
\]
There are two generalizations of these integrals, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and Riemann-Stieltjes integral.

Let the function $g:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be increasing and continuous on the right.
For a bounded measurable function $f:I\to\mathbb{R}$, define the \textbf{Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral} of $f$ with respect to $g$ over $[a,b]$, which we denote by $\int_{[a,b]}fdg$, by
